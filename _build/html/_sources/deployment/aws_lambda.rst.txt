AWS Lambda
==========

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers, executing code only when needed. WeAudit utilizes Lambda to handle various backend tasks dynamically.

Key Features
------------

- **Automatic Scaling**: Lambda functions scale automatically, executing code in response to each trigger.
- **No Server Management**: No need to manage servers or runtimes; just write the code and upload it to Lambda.
- **Subsecond Metering**: You are charged for every millisecond your code executes and the number of times your code is triggered.

Usage in WeAudit
----------------

WeAudit uses AWS Lambda for several purposes:

1. **Image Processing**: Lambdas are used to process images after generation, handling tasks such as resizing, filtering, and applying custom algorithms.
2. **Data Management**: Functions interact with AWS DynamoDB to manage metadata and other necessary data operations.
3. **API Responses**: Serve as the backend for API endpoints, handling requests and responses efficiently.

Deployment Procedure
---------------------

To deploy a Lambda function in WeAudit, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Code**: Write the function code in Python, ensuring it meets the AWS Lambda standards for runtime compatibility.
2. **Set Up IAM Roles**: Create an IAM role that grants your Lambda function permissions to access AWS resources like S3 buckets and DynamoDB.
3. **Package Dependencies**: If your function depends on external libraries, package them with your deployment package.
4. **Deploy**: Upload your code and dependencies via the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or automated CI/CD pipelines.
5. **Configure Triggers**: Set up the event sources that will trigger your function, such as HTTP requests via API Gateway or file uploads to S3.

Example Code
------------

Hereâ€™s a basic example of a Lambda function used in WeAudit:

.. code-block:: python

    import json

    def lambda_handler(event, context):
        # Your code logic here
        return {
            'statusCode': 200,
            'body': json.dumps('Hello from WeAudit Lambda')
        }

Monitoring and Logging
----------------------

- **AWS CloudWatch**: Used to monitor function executions, including viewing logs, setting alarms, and automatically reacting to changes in your AWS resources.
- **X-Ray Tracing**: Enables you to trace and analyze the user request journey through your AWS infrastructure.

Performance Optimization
------------------------

- **Memory Allocation**: Adjust the memory allocation to match the function's requirement for optimal performance.
- **Execution Timeout**: Set appropriate timeouts to prevent functions from running longer than necessary, which could increase costs.

Best Practices
--------------

- **Secure your Lambda functions** by defining minimal privilege access through IAM roles.
- **Optimize your code** to reduce execution time, which directly impacts costs.
- **Monitor and audit** function executions to ensure they perform as expected and within security guidelines.

Lambda functions play a critical role in WeAudit by handling high-volume requests quickly and cost-effectively, underpinning the platform's responsiveness and efficiency.
