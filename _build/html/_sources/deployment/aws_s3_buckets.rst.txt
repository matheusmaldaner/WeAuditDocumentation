AWS S3 Buckets
==============

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) provides scalable object storage for data backup, collection, and analytics. An ideal place for WeAudit to store generated images and other large data securely.

Features and Benefits
---------------------

- **Scalability**: Automatically scales to accommodate data growth.
- **Durability and Availability**: Offers industry-leading durability and availability.
- **Security**: Provides robust controls to ensure data is secure from unauthorized access.
- **Cost-Effective**: Storage pricing is based on usage, which means you pay only for what you use.

Usage in WeAudit
----------------

WeAudit uses Amazon S3 to:

1. **Store Generated Images**: All images created by the Replicate API are stored securely in S3 buckets.
2. **Backup and Archiving**: Keeps backups of important data, ensuring data durability and recoverability.
3. **Serve Static Files**: Hosts static files that are part of the WeAudit web application.

Setting Up S3 Buckets
---------------------

To create and configure an S3 bucket for WeAudit, follow these steps:

1. **Create the Bucket**:
   - Navigate to the S3 section in the AWS Management Console.
   - Click on 'Create Bucket', provide a name, and select the region.
   
2. **Configure Permissions**:
   - Apply bucket policies to manage access permissions.
   - Ensure that public access is blocked unless necessary.
   
3. **Enable Versioning**:
   - Turn on versioning to keep an immutable version of objects to protect against unintended deletes or overwrites.

4. **Set Lifecycle Policies**:
   - Define lifecycle rules to manage objects' lifespans, such as automatically archiving or deleting old data.

Example Configuration
---------------------

Below is an example of a bucket policy that grants read access to authenticated users:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Sid": "AddPerm",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": "*",
                "Action": "s3:GetObject",
                "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket/*",
                "Condition": {"StringEquals": {"aws:PrincipalOrgID": ["o-xxxxxxxxxxx"]}}
            }
        ]

Monitoring and Management
-------------------------

- **AWS CloudWatch**: Monitor bucket access and usage patterns.
- **AWS CloudTrail**: Track user activity and API usage for auditing.
- **S3 Analytics**: Analyze and optimize storage costs and performance.

Security Considerations
-----------------------

- **Encrypt Data at Rest**: Use S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) or AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) for encryption.
- **Secure Data in Transit**: Ensure data is transferred over SSL by enabling HTTPS access only on your bucket.

S3 buckets are integral to the storage strategy of WeAudit, providing a reliable and secure way to manage the application's data needs.
