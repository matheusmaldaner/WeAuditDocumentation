Discourse Deployment
====================

Discourse is used in WeAudit as a platform for community discussions, support, and collaboration. This section details the deployment process of Discourse, configuring it for optimal use within WeAudit.

Overview
--------

Discourse is an open-source discussion platform built for improving communication and social interaction for projects and communities. It is highly customizable and integrates well with modern web standards and services.

Deployment Steps
----------------

1. **Prepare Your Environment**:
   - Ensure you have a Virtual Private Server (VPS) or a cloud instance that meets Discourse's minimum hardware requirements: 1 GB RAM and 10 GB storage space.

2. **Install Docker**:
   - Discourse runs in a Docker container. Install Docker on your server if it's not already installed:
   
     .. code-block:: bash
     
         curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
         sh get-docker.sh

3. **Clone the Discourse Repository**:
   - Clone the official Discourse Docker repository to your server:

     .. code-block:: bash

         git clone https://github.com/discourse/discourse_docker.git /var/discourse

4. **Configure Discourse**:
   - Navigate to the cloned repository and run the setup script to start the configuration:

     .. code-block:: bash

         cd /var/discourse
         ./discourse-setup

   - Follow the prompts to set up Discourse, including SMTP settings for email, domain configuration, and administrative credentials.

5. **Launch Discourse**:
   - Once configured, Discourse will be deployed within a Docker container. Access your Discourse site by navigating to the domain you configured during setup.

Post-Deployment Configuration
-----------------------------

- **Customization**: Access the Discourse admin panel to customize the site appearance, settings, and plugins.
- **User Management**: Set up groups, categories, and permissions according to the needs of WeAudit.

Security Considerations
-----------------------

- Ensure that HTTPS is enabled to secure communications.
- Regularly update Discourse and Docker to protect against vulnerabilities.

This setup provides a robust discussion platform for WeAudit, facilitating community engagement and support.
