Setting Up Lightsail
--------------------

To set up a Lightsail instance for WeAudit, follow these steps:

1. **Create an Instance**:
   - Log into the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Lightsail dashboard.
   - Click on ‘Create instance’. Choose your instance image (e.g., Linux/Unix) and select an application (e.g., WordPress, Node.js).

2. **Configure the Instance**:
   - Choose your instance plan based on expected traffic and data needs.
   - Assign a static IP to ensure that the address does not change after restarts.

3. **Set Up Networking**:
   - Configure the networking settings to open ports needed for your applications, typically HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), and SSH (22).

Example Configuration
---------------------

Here’s an example of a typical configuration for a WeAudit Lightsail instance:

.. code-block:: text

    Region: US-East (N. Virginia)
    Blueprint: Linux/Unix
    Plan: $10/month (2 GB RAM, 1 vCPU, 60 GB SSD)
    Static IP: Enabled
    Networking: Firewall rules for HTTP, HTTPS, SSH

Monitoring and Management
-------------------------

- **Snapshots**: Regularly take snapshots of your Lightsail instance to ensure that you have backups available in case of failure.
- **Monitoring Tools**: Utilize Lightsail's built-in monitoring tools to keep track of CPU usage, network traffic, and disk I/O.

Security Considerations
-----------------------

- **Data Security**: Implement proper security groups and rules that strictly limit access based on the least privilege principle.
- **SSL/TLS**: Secure your data in transit by installing SSL/TLS certificates for your web applications hosted on Lightsail.

Amazon Lightsail provides a low-friction entry point to AWS, making it suitable for startups and small projects within WeAudit that require straightforward solutions with predictable costs.
