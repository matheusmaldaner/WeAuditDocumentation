Replicate Usage
===============

Replicate is a core component in WeAudit for generating AI-driven images. It provides access to various pre-trained models and facilitates the creation of images based on textual prompts.

How We Use Replicate
--------------------

WeAudit integrates Replicate to:

1. **Generate Images**: Leverage state-of-the-art models for generating images directly from textual descriptions.
2. **Custom Model Deployment**: Deploy and manage custom models specific to WeAudit's needs, enhancing the platform's capability to audit AI behaviors.

Setting Up Replicate
--------------------

To utilize Replicate within WeAudit:

1. **API Key Configuration**:
   - Obtain an API key from Replicate.
   - Securely store and use the key in your application to authenticate API requests.

2. **Making API Calls**:
   - Use the Replicate API to send image generation requests.
   - Handle the JSON responses that include URLs to the generated images.

Example API Call
----------------

Below is an example of using the Replicate API to generate an image:

.. code-block:: python

    import requests

    def generate_image(prompt):
        url = "https://api.replicate.com/v1/predictions"
        headers = {'Authorization': 'Token YOUR_REPLICATE_API_KEY'}
        data = {'version': 'certain-model-version', 'input': {'prompt': prompt}}

        response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
        return response.json()

This function sends a request to generate an image based on a prompt, returning the JSON response from Replicate.
