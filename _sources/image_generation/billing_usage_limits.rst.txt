Billing and Usage Limits
========================

Billing Structure
-----------------

- **Per Use Billing**: Charges are incurred per image generation call, based on the model used and the computational resources consumed.

Usage Limits
------------

- **Monthly Budget**: Ensure that usage remains within the allocated budget of $100 per month.
- **Concurrency Limits**: Several text-to-image models cap the amount of images able to be generated at 4. In order to bypass this, we can send concurrent jobs, so if the user needs to generate 10 images we can generate 4 + 4 + 2 in parallel.


Strategies to Manage Costs
--------------------------

- Check Replicate to see how much money has been spent in the previous month and which models are the most expensive.
